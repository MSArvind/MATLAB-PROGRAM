 Homework 6 :To determine the strength at first ply failure (FPF)
)A [0°/25°/65°/-65°/-25°]S laminate has the following ply properties E1 = 21 Msi E2 = 1.2 Msi G12 = 0.7 Msi 12 = 0.3 F1t = F1c = 250 ksi F2t = 8 ksi F2c = 30 ksi F6 = 10ksi Determine the strength 𝐹0at first ply failure (FPF) using a) Maximum stress criterion b) Tsai-Wu criterion. For the following loading conditions: i) 𝑁𝑥 = 𝐹0 𝑁𝑦 = 𝑁𝑠 = 0 ii) 𝑁𝑥 = 𝑁𝑦 = 𝑁𝑠 = 𝐹0 iii) 𝑀𝑦 = 𝑀0 𝑀𝑥 = 𝑀𝑠 = 0 iv) 𝑀𝑥 = 𝑀𝑦 = 𝑀𝑠 = 𝑀0
